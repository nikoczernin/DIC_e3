- install required libraries!
- download weights and input images from TUWEL
- always commit and push immedeately and intermedeately, noone likes having to sift through changes just because someone else was lazy!
- DO NOT "Add" input images folder `input_folder`, so that nobody else has to download them! same goes for `yolo_tiny_configs`
